Pay at Table HTML/JS Templates
=============================
The following HTML and JS templates were designed to help assist POS partners with setting up Pay at Table functionality in association with PayPal's Point of Sale & Mobile In-Store framework.  The templates will not function alone, but should act as a front-end and UI guide while integrating with a backend technology.

PLEASE NOTE: These pages are for demonstration purposes only and *will not* move any money unless hooked up to Point of Sale & Mobile In-Store APIs. 

For Demo Purposes Only:
- Table 12 and 22 have open invoices.  

Invoices and Merchant configuration can be done through the .json files in the objects directory.

Version 2.0
